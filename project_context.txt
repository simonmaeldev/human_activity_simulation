PROJECT CONTEXT - Agent-Based Environmental Simulation

Purpose:
This project creates an agent-based simulation where different populations act as autonomous agents, making decisions to survive, grow, and expand within their environment. The simulation models how these agent decisions and interactions lead to emergent environmental patterns and changes over time.

How The Code Works:
1. Entry Point and Flow:
   - main.py creates the initial configuration (grid size, random seed)
   - SimulationController orchestrates the entire simulation
   - Each simulation day updates environment, populations, and collects data
   - Results are logged and exported to CSV files

2. Key Components and Files:
   - SimulationController (simulation_controller.py): Main orchestrator
   - Environment (environment.py): Manages the grid and cell states
   - Cell Types (cell.py): CITY, FOREST, LAKE, LAND implementations
   - Population Types (population.py): HUMANS, WILDLIFE, FISH, PESTS, TREES
   - Managers:
     * ResourceManager: Handles resource consumption and regeneration
     * PollutionManager: Controls pollution spread and decay
     * PopulationManager: Manages population behaviors
     * Cell-specific managers in cell_managers/

3. Configuration:
   - ConfigModel (config_model.py): Customizable parameters
     * Grid size, random seed
     * Resource regeneration rates
     * Health thresholds
     * Population thresholds
   - Constants (constants.py): Fixed simulation parameters
     * Growth/decline rates
     * Maximum densities
     * Time thresholds
     * Health impact factors

4. Data Collection and Output:
   - DataCollector: Gathers metrics about cells, populations, global state
   - CSVExporter: Exports data to timestamped directories
   - Logging: Progress updates and simulation statistics

5. Time Scales:
   - Daily: Resource consumption, pollution spread, health updates
   - Weekly: Population growth/decline checks, progress logging
   - Yearly: City abandonment (365 days)
   - Long-term: Forest growth (1825 days)

Core Concepts:
1. Agent Types and Goals:
Each population type is an autonomous agent with primary objectives:
- Survival (maintain health)
- Growth (increase population size)
- Expansion (spread to new cells)

2. Population Agents:
Humans:
- Can actively modify environment (convert cells)
- Make decisions about resource consumption
- Expand cities when population grows
- Generate pollution through activities
- Migration based on resource quality and cell health

Wildlife:
- Migrate based on resource availability and cell health
- Make resource consumption choices
- Cannot modify environment
- Health affected by pollution and resource quality

Trees/Forests:
- Natural expansion to abandoned areas
- Spread rate affected by nearby forest health
- Passive conversion of abandoned cells
- CO2 absorption based on health

3. Agent Decision Making:
Resource Consumption:
- Agents choose resource sources based on:
  * Resource quality (pollution levels)
  * Distance to resource
  * Available quantity
  * Competition with other agents

Migration:
- Populations can migrate to nearby cells
- Success rate depends on:
  * Distance (further = lower success)
  * Population health (healthier = higher success)
  * Target cell capacity and conditions

Cell Conversion:
- Humans can convert cells for their needs:
  * Forest/Land → Agricultural Land (for food)
  * Land → City (for population growth)
  * Conversion produces pollution/CO2
- Forests naturally reclaim abandoned areas:
  * Conversion speed based on nearby forest health
  * Requires sustained abandonment period

4. Environmental Feedback:
- Resource depletion affects agent health
- Pollution impacts migration decisions
- Cell conversions affect resource availability
- Population density influences expansion choices

5. Emergent Behaviors:
- Urban sprawl from population growth
- Natural reforestation of abandoned areas
- Wildlife migration patterns
- Resource competition between populations
- Pollution hotspots and clean zones

6. Data Collection:
- Track agent decisions and outcomes
- Monitor population movements
- Record cell conversions
- Measure environmental changes
- Export data for analysis

The simulation uses SimPy for event handling and Pydantic for data validation. Each agent makes autonomous decisions daily, creating complex system behaviors through their interactions and environmental impacts.
