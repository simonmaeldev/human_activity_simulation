PROJECT CONTEXT - Human Activity Environmental Simulation

Purpose:
This project creates an agent-based simulation to model the impact of human activity on the environment. The simulation runs on a grid where each cell represents different types of environment (cities, forests, lakes, lands) and contains populations that interact with resources and generate pollution.

Core Concepts:
1. Grid Structure:
- Square grid (configurable size, default 100x100)
- Each cell has one type: city, forest, lake, or land
- Cells contain populations and resources

2. Population Types:
- Humans (in cities)
- Wildlife (in forests)
- Fish (in lakes)
- Pests (in lands)
- Trees/Plants (in forests)

3. Resource System:
Lakes:
- Natural water regeneration at constant rate
- Water level shared between connected lake cells
- Supports aquatic life (fish populations)
- Pollution levels shared between connected lake cells

Lands:
- Produces food
- Requires water for irrigation
- Absorbs some water pollution during irrigation
- Food consumed by humans and pests

Forests:
- Produces trees as resource
- Contains wildlife populations
- Consumes water
- Wildlife consumes small amounts of trees and water

Cities:
- Consume water for human population
- Consume food from lands
- Produce CO2 and pollution based solely on population
- Pollution production not affected by existing pollution

4. Resource Interactions:
- Water flows between connected lake cells
- Irrigation of lands helps clean water pollution
- Forest water consumption affects local water availability
- Human consumption prioritized over other uses

5. Pollution System:
- Cities generate air pollution based on population size
- Air pollution spreads quickly between cells
- Air pollution gradually settles into ground/water pollution
- When resources are consumed, pollution is transferred proportionally:
  * Example: If a lake is 50% polluted and 30% of water is used,
    15% of total pollution is removed with the water
  * Pollution concentration remains constant unless treated
- Only plants can reduce pollution concentration through absorption
- Cities' pollution generation is based solely on population size

6. Data Collection:
- Track all metrics daily
- Export data to CSV files by cell type

The simulation uses SimPy for event handling and Pydantic for data validation and structure. Each step in the simulation represents one day, allowing for realistic modeling of environmental changes over time.
