PROJECT CONTEXT - Human Activity Environmental Simulation

Purpose:
This project creates an agent-based simulation to model the impact of human activity on the environment. The simulation runs on a grid where each cell represents different types of environment (cities, forests, lakes, lands) and contains populations that interact with resources and generate pollution.

Core Concepts:
1. Grid Structure:
- Square grid (configurable size, default 100x100)
- Each cell has one type: city, forest, lake, or land
- Cells contain populations and resources

2. Population Types:
- Humans (in cities)
- Wildlife (in forests)
- Fish (in lakes)
- Pests (in lands)
- Trees/Plants (in forests)

3. Resources and Health:
- Each cell and population has health (0-100%)
- Resources: water, food, clean air
- Resource quality affected by pollution
- Consuming polluted resources reduces health
- Proximity to nature increases health

4. Pollution Mechanics:
- Global CO2 tracking across entire grid
- Local pollution in cells
- Pollution spreads between cells
- Trees reduce global CO2
- Natural pollution decay over time

5. Human Activity (Daily Steps):
- Each simulation step represents one day
- Daily activities happen simultaneously:
  * Work and commuting generate pollution and CO2
  * Resource consumption occurs once per day
  * Pollution impact is calculated daily
- Humans have priority in resource consumption
- Cities expand based on health and resource abundance
- Can convert forests/lands to cities, forests to lands

6. Environmental Rules:
- Resources regenerate daily based on cell health
- Populations adjust to environmental conditions each day
- Water refills at daily rate
- Wildlife relocates if habitat becomes critically unhealthy
- Cell type conversions are agent-driven decisions:
  * Humans (through city planning) can convert:
    - Forest to Land (deforestation)
    - Land to City (urbanization)
    - Land to Forest (reforestation)
  * Each conversion action:
    - Generates CO2 emissions
    - Creates temporary pollution in surrounding cells
    - Requires resource investment
    - Takes multiple days to complete

7. Data Collection:
- Track all metrics daily
- Export data to CSV files by cell type

The simulation uses SimPy for event handling and Pydantic for data validation and structure. Each step in the simulation represents one day, allowing for realistic modeling of environmental changes over time.
